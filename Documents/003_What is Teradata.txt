1. What is Teradata?

Teradata is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) for the worldâ€™s largest
commercial databases. 

It is possible to have databases with over 100 terabytes (of data) in
size. 

This characteristic makes Teradata an obvious choice for large data warehousing
applications; however the Teradata system may also be as small as 100 gigabytes. 

With its parallelism and scalability, Teradata allows you to start small with a single node and grow
large with many nodes through linear expandability

Teradata is comparable to a large database server, with multiple client application making
inquiries against it concurrently.

Teradata 14.0 was released on February 14, 2012.
Teradata 14.10 was released on July 24, 2013.

The ability to manage terabytes of data is accomplished using the concept of parallelism,
where in many individual processors perform smaller tasks concurrently to accomplish an
operation against a huge repository of data. 
To date, only parallel architectures can handle databases of this size.
