How large is a Trillion and a Quadrillion?

The Teradata Database was the first commercial database system to support a trillion bytes
of data. 

It is hard to imagine the size of a trillion. 

To put it in perspective, the life span of the average person is 2.5 gigaseconds 
(or said differently 2,500,000,000 seconds). 
A trillion seconds is 31,688 years!

Teradata has customers with multiple petabytes of data. One petabyte is one quadrillion
bytes of data. 
A petabyte is effectively 1000 terabyes.
