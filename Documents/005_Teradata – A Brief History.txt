Teradata – A Brief History

The Teradata Corporation was founded in 1979 in Los Angeles, California. 

The corporate goal was the creation of a “database computer” which could handle billions of rows of data,
up to and beyond a terabyte of data storage. 

It took five years of development before a product was shipped to a first customer in 1984. 
In 1982, the YNET technology was patented as the enabling technology for the parallelism that was at the heart of the
architecture. 

The YNET was the interconnect which allowed hundreds of individual processors to share the same bandwidth.
In 1987, Teradata went public with its first stock offering. 
In 1988, Teradata partnered with the NCR Corporation to build the next generation of database computers (e.g., 3700).
Before either company could market its next generation product, NCR was purchased by AT&T Corporation at the end of 1991.

AT&T purchased Teradata and folded Teradata into the NCR structure in January of 1992.
The new division was named AT&T GIS (Global Information Solutions).

In 1996, AT&T spun off three separate companies, one of which was NCR which then returned to its old name. 
Teradata was a division of NCR from 1997 until 2001. 
In 1997,
Teradata (as part of NCR) had become the world leader in scalable data warehouse solutions.
In 2007, NCR and Teradata separated as two corporations.
