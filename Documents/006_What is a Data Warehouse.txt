What is a Data Warehouse?

A data warehouse is a central, enterprise-wide 
database that contains information extracted from the operational data stores. 

Data warehouses have become more common in corporations where enterprise-wide detail data may
be used in on-line analytical processing to make strategic and tactical business decisions. 

Warehouses often carry many years worth of detail data so that historical trends may be analyzed using the 
full power of the data.

Many data warehouses get their data directly from operational systems so that the data is
timely and accurate. 

While data warehouses may begin somewhat small in scope and purpose, they often grow quite large as 
their utility becomes more fully exploited by the enterprise.

Data Warehousing is a process, not a product. It is a technique to properly assemble and
manage data from various sources to answer business questions not previously possible or
known.
