Data Marts

A data mart is a special purpose subset of enterprise data used by a particular department,
function or application. Data marts may have both summary and detail data, however,
usually the data has been pre-aggregated or transformed in some way to better handle the
particular type of requests of a specific user community

Independent Data Marts

Independent data marts are created directly from operational systems, just as is a data
warehouse. In the data mart, the data is usually transformed as part of the load process.
Data might be aggregated, dimensionalized or summarized historically, as the requirements
of the data mart dictate.
